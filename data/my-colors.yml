# This list color-codes the Life in Weeks grid.
# The box's border color represents where I was living,
# the background color what I was doing that week.
# The based and doing values should match what is in events.yml.
# Convert based and doing class_name's to lower case and replace spaces with dashes
# i.e., New York City becomes new-york-city
