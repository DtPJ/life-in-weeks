This is a map of my life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. The box's border color represents where I was living, the fill color what I was doing. Tap a box to find out what was going on for me that week.

Concept by [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), code copied from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks), modified by [Gina Trapani](https://ginatrapani.org). To make one of your own, I recommend [weeksofyour.life](https://www.weeksofyour.life/).

Note: This life and this map are a work in progress. I'll update it as I go.
