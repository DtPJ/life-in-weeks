ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Gina](https://ginatrapani.org). This is a map of my life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. Hover over or tap a box to find out more about that week.

ðŸ§  Based on [Life in Weeks by Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). Code adapted from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks) by [Gina Trapani](https://ginatrapani.org) available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks).

ðŸ“Œ Note: This life and this map are a work in progress. I'll update it as I go.
